# T-GCN
The GCN and GRU models were in gcn.py and gru.py respective.


The T-GCN model was in the tgcn.py


In order to use the model, we need
* A N by N adjacency matrix, which describes the connection relationships between nodes
* A N by D feature matrix, which describes the attribute values of nodes
